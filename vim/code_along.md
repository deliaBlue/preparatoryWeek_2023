# Code Along and Get Better

`Vim` is all about speed, but at first is all about learning and practicing.
Here there are a series of exercises to help you with that. There could
be different paths to reach the solution, do not worry about finding all of
them, just on finding one. If you get stuck in any exercise do not look at
the solution but at the notes. If you still do not see the way to solve the 
exercise, you can look the answer, and if you do not understand it, don't

## Edgar Allan Poe has been tricked

Edgar Allan Poe's last complete poem can be found on [this file](help_Poe.txt).
After many years on the internet, some weird things had happened to it. By
following the next steps, you can help on recovering the original text.

Are you ready?

### Yank and Paste

The location where the story takes place has been removed from all the text
except from the fourth line. Yank "kingdom by the sea" in the fourth line.
Paste it before the last character in lines 11, 18, and 24.

### Delete

Some music groups and songs had sneaked into the poem. Get rid of the extra
words that form their names to get them out of the story.

- Ben L'Oncle soul -> soul (line 38)
- Fallen angels -> angels (line 26)
- Iron maiden -> maiden (line 7)
- Larkin Poe -> Poe (last line)
- lion eyes -> eyes (line 43)
- motherless child -> child (line 10)
- One winged Angel -> winged (line 14)
- running away -> away (line 22)

After all this time, a couple of words decided they wanted to have a different
meaning. Return them to what they have to be by just deleting one character or
swapping it by another one. Here's the list with the original words to be
fixed:

- bride (line 46)
- kinsman (line 21)
- other (line 7)
- night (line 30)
- tomb (line 48)
- sea (line 37)

### Change

Someone thought that if the text rime, no one will know it is not the
real one. Change the content within parenthesis in lines 28-29 to the following:

(as all men know,
  in this kingdom by the sea)

### Switch Case and Shift lines

The aesthetic of the poem was for Edgar Allan Poe as important as its content,
but somehow now is completely different.

Paragraphs 3 (starting at line 17) and 6 (starting at line 41) are shift to the
right 2 and 5 times respectively. Put them back were they belong.

Switch to upper-case the first character of the lines that start in lower-case
in order to have the appearance of the original manuscript.

### Search

It is known that the second name of the beautiful woman the poem is about is
just "Lee".

Delete the repeated "Lee" in the poem title and add a "Lee" each time there is
an "Ammabel" in the poem.

### Find and Replace

Something else in the woman's name is wrong... this poem was about Annabel Lee,
not to Ammabel Lee. Return it to whom it belong.

### Write and Quit

Congratulations! You fixed this beautiful poem and help Edgar Allan Poe to
preserve it over time! It is time for you to save the changes and close the
file.
